check:

student_index.php -  (now uses get_points.php for updating student points after scanning) 

+ redeem.php - (should work as is, gpt says)
    Concurrency issue – If two redemption requests happen simultaneously, 
    currentPoints check might have a race condition. 
    For high-stakes points, consider doing the deduction in one SQL transaction or UPDATE ... WHERE points >= ?.

points.php - (works as is, gpt says)


verify_qr.php - test ver adjusts $_GET -> $_POST because student_index.php with get_points.php uses $_POST

generate_qr.php - WORKS AS IS, NO MODIFICATIONS (gpt says)
Suggested Improvements: 
Better deletion check to avoid accidental substring matches:               
                        $parts = explode('|', $line);
                            if ($parts[0] !== $deleteCode) {
                            $updated[] = $line;
                        }
