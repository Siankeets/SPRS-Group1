Swapping hrefs/redirects:

Login.php -> student_index-test.php (test ver. already uses get_points.php)
student_index-test.php -> redeem-test.php (these will do, only testing these two main student files)
redeem-test.php -> student_index-test.php (these will do, only testing these two main student files)

=====================================================================================================

staff_index.php ->  points-test.php  (remember to revert staff_index.php to redirect to points.php)
points-test.php -> generate_qr-test.php
generate_qr-test.php -> verify_qr-test.php
