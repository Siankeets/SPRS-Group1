ABD:11/20/2025: api folder seems to only need renaming of select_db()s

these have all been adjusted.

added session_start() for revisioned admin/help.php + admin verification, i dont think theres BIG BIG changes besides copy pasting the revision in.

NOTE:idk why but my net is slow or something, harder to update / adjust stuff to infinityfree but im also having some difficulties so i might just not finish these tonight.

gonna test helpdesk instead of qr, seems easier. atleast get some considerable progress there.

NOTE2: loading speed is absolutely criminal tonight wtf, harder to test in infinity free when i need to access both dashboards for helpdesk.

ADMIN ALICE <-> STUDENT JUAN HELPDESK TESTED AND WORKING - SEE CHAT LOGS. no other admins and students were tested.
==================================================

}

function nowDateTime() {
    return date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
}
