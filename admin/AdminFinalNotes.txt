events works fine, notif is acting funny

events.php LINE 331 -> 333: changed the const imageInput = ''; triggers a fail notif because its not declared
// safely clear file input if present
const imageInput = document.getElementById('eventImage');
if (imageInput) imageInput.value = '';

manage_events.php:
LINE 36: added back $event['eventImage'] = $row['eventImage']; (this works with the landing page.)
LINE 38 -> 43 : commented out "correct" image path.
